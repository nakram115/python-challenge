# python-challenge

Used two sets of poll data (`election_data_1.csv` and `election_data_2.csv`). Each dataset was composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
